[Gameplay gif](https://twitter.com/eguneys/status/1299769426644959234?s=20).

Controls:

`Left Right` to move.

`Down` to look down.

`X` to jump.

`Enter` to see progress.

There are 5 levels, and 12 collectibles.

There is wall jumping. And jump grace where you can still jump a few frames after you leave the ground, which you have to use to pass levels. Spikes have a smaller hit-box than they look.

A series of tutorials I wrote before this game:
    [How to make a 2D platformer](https://github.com/eguneys/celeste-jumping) (in PICO-8). Explains physics, collision detection, etc. I used in this game.

See [design document for Coler](DRAFT.md).

To run in development:

    yarn install
    yarn start
    // browse localhost:3000
